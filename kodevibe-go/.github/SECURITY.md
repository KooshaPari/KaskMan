## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in KodeVibe, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to security@kodevibe.com with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within the following timeframes:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues, 30 days for others
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have had time to update

### Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledge**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigate**: Our security team will investigate the report
3. **Confirm**: We will confirm whether the issue is a valid security vulnerability
4. **Develop Fix**: We will develop and test a fix for the issue
5. **Release**: We will release a patched version
6. **Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the issue after users have had time to update

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not disclose the issue until a fix is available
- We will credit the reporter (if desired) in our security advisory
- We may provide a bounty for significant security findings (contact us for details)

### Security Best Practices

When using KodeVibe:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Review and secure your configuration files
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to KodeVibe APIs and interfaces
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS and secure network configurations
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs when integrating with KodeVibe
6. **Audit Logs**: Monitor and audit KodeVibe usage logs

### Security Features

KodeVibe includes the following security features:

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: API endpoints support authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different operations
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration defaults
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Known Security Considerations

- File system access: KodeVibe requires file system access to analyze code
- Command execution: Some checkers may execute system commands
- Network access: The API server opens network ports
- Dependencies: Security depends on third-party dependencies

### Security Testing

We regularly perform:

- Static analysis security testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews with security focus

### Reporting Non-Security Issues

For non-security related bugs, please use our standard GitHub issue reporting process at https://github.com/kooshapari/kodevibe-go/issues
